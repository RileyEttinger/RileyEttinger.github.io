Also, i am going to my next IT class soon so i might not have some new things for a bit but always watchout for new things. Also, i have 6 family members, my mom katie, my dad allen, my grandma holly, my grandpa larry, my uncle bobby, and my sister destiny but she moved to california and i would li,e to go visit her some day. </p>
                <p>Second, i live way down in airville PA near the sesquahana river so there is alot of nice forest to explore. i like to live in the middle of no where because then there is not alot of people around me. And, i live very far away from any stores or resteraunts so i dont really get out and about that much. Also, i like to work on my minibike,sometimes cars, and i like to work with computers. so i also like to play alot of games like gmod,GTA5, and mosty building and shooting games. Finally, always remember to have a fantasic day, to go out once in a while, and see and make some friends.  </p>
